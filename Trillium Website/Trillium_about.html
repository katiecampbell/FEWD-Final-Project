				<p>Since 2003, Trillium Publishing has been a hub for some of the best people in literacy education who work to create exceptional materials for students and teachers in the US and around the world. Although K-6 literacy continues to be our primary area of expertise, over the years we have expanded our in-house knowledge to include K-12 literacy and math and have integrated social studies, science, and social-emotional learning across a wide variety of print and online materials. 
				<br></br>
				Our uniqueness lies in the value we add to our clients' projects. Like all development services groups, we generate a great variety of projects, but the ones we like best are those to which we bring our extensive educational expertise, partnering with our clients to elevate the effectiveness of their educational strategies and materials. </p>
